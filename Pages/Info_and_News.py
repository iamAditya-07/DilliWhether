st.markdown('The present study focusses on the different exposure levels recorded by  commuters  using  six modes  of transport  in  Delhi  and  the results showed  that  travellers  in  open  modes  of  transport  **(rickshaws  and walking)**  were  exposed  to  the  highest  PM2.5 concentrations.  Inside enclosed modes of transports which used AC, including **private cars** and the **metro**, were found to have signiî€¾cantly lower PM2.5 concentrations. The exposure levels  for passengers on  **buses**  and travellers in  **non-AC cars** were found to lie between fully closed and open transport modes. Nevertheless,  open  windows  and the  frequency of opening  doors  on buses resulted  in ambient pollution  (background plus  that emitted by other vehicles) entering vehicles, thus increasing the concentrations to which travellers were exposed');
